# First thing to work on with just Python basics
Write the code to print out "Hello, World" with a carriage return
on the end that will pass the linting rules and a test that verifies it works.

# To prepare the repo for work run the following commands
```
cd 01
py -m venv ./venv
./venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd content
```

Then attemp to make it all work the file should pass tests when pytest is ran and it should pass when pylint is ran against hellow world

This is a work in progress as we move forward im hopeful these will be less messy.

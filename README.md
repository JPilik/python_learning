# python_learning
Python repo for me to use to learn python best practices

Getting Started go to 
* https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.39.2.windows.1/Git-2.39.2-64-bit.exe
and download git and install it

Go to 
* https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.2/python-3.11.2-amd64.exe
And get python and install it

once those are done update pip to the latest version
* python.exe -m pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org --upgrade pip

Usefull commands
py <script>.py -> run the said script in windows
pytest <script>_test.py -> run the unit tests associated with your scipt
pylint <script>.py or <script>_test.py -> run linter against script or test script to ensure proper formatting/annotations

within the content folder run the following
py -m pydoc -b -> Should pop open a web browser with a huge amount of documentation to include what was added in by your code.
